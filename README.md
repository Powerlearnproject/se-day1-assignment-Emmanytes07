#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the act of systematically applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The introduction of high-level programming languages like Fortran and Cobol and these helped programmers to write readable and less complex codes. this is between 1950s-1960s
2. The ememrgence of structured programming between 1960s and 1970s,this helps to create clear control structures like loops, conditionals and also modular design which helps to reduce complexity and improves code readability.
3. The Agile Methodology movement (2000s); the Agile Manifesto 2001 brought about principles for lightweight, flexible software development that priortized collaboration, customer feedback and incremental progress over rigid planning and has helped to revolutionized software engineering in such a way that promotes iterative development, adaptive planning and faster delivery cycles.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Requirements: This phase involves the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements.
ii. Design: Here the creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface is done.
iii. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
iv. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
v. Deployment: At this phase, the software is released to users or customers.
vi. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a strict step-by-step process of building a project from scratch to finish and it involves thorough planning from beginning to end because it does not give room for much or no adjustment later while Agile on the other hand allows for iteration, flexibility while building a project and this way there is room for adjustment or making changes whenever and wherever needed.
Scenarios:
Waterfall: This can be like when a house is to be built, the plan and structure has to well spelt out because once you begin by laying the foundation there's no changes that can be made.
Agile: this can be likened to cooking where there is room for tasting of the food and whenever there's need salt, maggi, water can be added as needed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): This is a Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio code, Eclipse etc.
Version Control Systems (VCS): They are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges software engineers face are Changing requirements, Tight deadlines, Technical debt to name a few. Strategies to overcome these challenges are:
i. Effective communication
ii. Agile methodologies
iii. priortization of tasks
iv. Constant reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.

Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.

System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

All the above helps in ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from robot or AI assistant. It's important in the sense that it allows for concise and well structured queries are sent to an AI to get an effective result.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt to AI: Give me a name?
Response: A name can vary depending on location, religion, tribe but i will be happy to provide you with some exmaples such as John, Anna, Michael. If you need more names kindly let me know.

Clear, concise and Specific prompt: Give me a name of a lady of yoruba tribe in Nigeria?
Response: The name of a lady in Yoruba tribe in Nigeria West Africa can be Sola, Ayomide, Seun etc.

Improved prompt is more effective because it gives the AI a more focused, specific and concise question to work on which brings about a desired result for user of such AI technology.
